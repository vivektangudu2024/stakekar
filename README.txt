 Stakekar is based on a very good technique called Car pooling.
       Carpooling (also car-sharing, ride-sharing and lift-sharing) is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car, and prevents the need for others to have to drive to a location themselves.
        By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each person's travel costs such as: fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving. Carpooling is also a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces air pollution, carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking spaces.
     we used this idea and allows car owners to offer a ride to their destination in website and lessees who have same destination can select the offer.
      They are connected through our website and share can be decided by them.
